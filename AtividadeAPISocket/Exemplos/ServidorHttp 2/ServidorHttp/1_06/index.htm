<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Having now
briefly considered the major pieces of the Internet architecture--the applications,
end systems, end-to-end transport protocols, routers, and links--let us
now consider what can happen to a packet as it travels from its source
to its destination. Recall that a packet starts in a host (the source),
passes through a series of routers, and ends its journey in another host
(the destination). As a packet travels from one node (host or router) to
the subsequent node (host or router) along this path, the packet suffers
from several different types of delays at <i>each</i> node along the path.
The most important of these delays are the <b>nodal processing delay, queuing
delay, transmission delay,</b> and <b>propagation delay;</b> together,
these delays accumulate to give a <b>total nodal delay.</b> In order to
acquire a deep understanding of packet switching and computer networks,
we must understand the nature and importance of these delays.&nbsp;</font></font>
<h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>1.6.1: Types of
Delay</font></font></h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Let us explore
these delays in the context of Figure 1.19. As part of its end-to-end route
between source and destination, a packet is sent from the upstream node
through router A to router B. Our goal is to characterize the nodal delay
at router A. Note that router A has an outbound link leading to router
B. This link is preceded by a queue (also known as a buffer). When the
packet arrives at router A from the upstream node, router A examines the
packet's header to determine the appropriate outbound link for the packet,
and then directs the packet to the link. In this example, the outbound
link for the packet is the one that leads to router B. A packet can be
transmitted on a link only if there is no other packet currently being
transmitted on the link and if there are no other packets preceding it
in the queue; if the link is currently busy or if there are other packets
already queued for the link, the newly arriving packet will then join the
queue.&nbsp;</font></font>

<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Processing
Delay</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The time required
to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet
is part of the <b>processing delay.</b> The processing delay can also include
other factors, such as the time needed to check for bit-level errors in
the packet that occurred in transmitting the packet's bits from the upstream
router to router A. Processing delays in high-speed routers are typically
on the order of microseconds or less. After this nodal processing, the
router directs the packet to the queue that precedes the link to router
B. (In Section 4.6 we will study the details of how a router operates.)&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Queuing Delay</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>At the queue,
the packet experiences a <b>queuing delay</b> as it waits to be transmitted
onto the link. The queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on the
number of other, earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for
transmission across the link. The delay of a given packet can vary significantly
from packet to packet. If the queue is empty and no other packet is currently
being transmitted, then our packet's queuing delay is zero. On the other
hand, if the traffic is heavy and many other packets are also waiting to
be transmitted, the queuing delay will be long. We will see shortly that
the number of packets that an arriving packet might expect to find on arrival
is a function of the intensity and nature of the traffic arriving to the
queue. Queuing delays can be on the order of milliseconds to microseconds
in practice.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Transmission
Delay</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Assuming that
packets are transmitted in first-come-first-serve manner, as is common
in the Internet, our packet can be transmitted once all the packets that
have arrived before it have been transmitted. Denote the length of the
packet by <i>L</i> bits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from
router A to router B by <i>R</i> bits/sec. The rate <i>R</i> is determined
by transmission rate of the link to router B. For example, for a 10-Mbps
Ethernet link, the rate is <i>R</i> = 10 Mbps; for a 100-Mbps Ethernet
link, the rate is <i>R</i> = 100 Mbps. The <b>transmission delay</b> (also
called the store-and-forward delay, as discussed in Section 1.4) is <i>L/R.</i>
This is the amount of time required to transmit all of the packet's bits
into the link. Transmission delays are typically on the order of microseconds
or less in practice.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Propagation
Delay</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Once a bit is
pushed onto the link, it needs to propagate to router B. The time required
to propagate from the beginning of the link to router B is the <b>propagation
delay.</b> The bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link. The
propagation speed depends on the physical medium of the link (that is,
multimode fiber, twisted-pair copper wire, and so on) and is in the range
of&nbsp;</font></font>
<center>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>2 • 10<sup>8</sup>
meters/sec to 3 • 10<sup>8</sup> meters/sec&nbsp;</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>which is equal
to, or a little less than, the speed of light. The propagation delay is
the distance between two routers divided by the propagation speed. That
is, the propagation delay is <i>d/s, </i>where <i>d</i> is the distance
between router A and router B and <i>s</i> is the propagation speed of
the link. Once the last bit of the packet propagates to node B, it and
all the preceding bits of the packet are stored in router B. The whole
process then continues with router B now performing the forwarding. In
wide-area networks, propagation delays are on the order of milliseconds.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Comparing
Transmission and Propagation Delay</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Newcomers to
the field of computer networking sometimes have difficulty understanding
the difference between transmission delay and propagation delay. The difference
is subtle but important. The transmission delay is the amount of time required
for the router to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet's
length and the transmission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with
the distance between the two routers. The propagation delay, on the other
hand, is the time it takes a bit to propagate from one router to the next;
it is a function of the distance between the two routers, but has nothing
to do with the packet's length or the transmission rate of the link.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>An analogy might
clarify the notions of transmission and propagation delay. Consider a highway
that has a toll booth every 100 kilometers. You can think of the highway
segments between toll booths as links and the toll booths as routers. Suppose
that cars travel (that is, propagate) on the highway at a rate of 100 km/
hour (that is, when a car leaves a toll booth, it instantaneously accelerates
to 100 km/hour and maintains that speed between toll booths). Suppose that
there is a caravan of 10 cars that are traveling together, and that these
10 cars follow each other in a fixed order. You can think of each car as
a bit and the caravan as a packet. Also suppose that each toll booth services
(that is, transmits) a car at a rate of one car per 12 seconds, and that
it is late at night so that the caravan's cars are the only cars on the
highway. Finally, suppose that whenever the first car of the caravan arrives
at a toll booth, it waits at the entrance until the nine other cars have
arrived and lined up behind it. (Thus the entire caravan must be "stored"
at the toll booth before it can begin to be "forwarded.") The time required
for the toll booth to push the entire caravan onto the highway is 10/(5
cars/minute) = 2 minutes. This time is analogous to the transmission delay
in a router. The time required for a car to travel from the exit of one
toll booth to the next toll booth is 100 km/(100 km/hour) = 1 hour. This
time is analogous to propagation delay. Therefore, the time from when the
caravan is "stored" in front of a toll booth until the caravan is "stored"
in front of the next toll booth is the sum of "transmission delay" and
"the propagation delay"--in this example, 62 minutes.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Let's explore
this analogy a bit more. What would happen if the toll-booth service time
for a caravan were greater than the time for a car to travel between toll
booths? For example, suppose cars travel at rate 1,000 km/hr and the toll
booth services cars at rate one car per minute. Then the traveling delay
between toll booths is 6 minutes and the time to serve a caravan is 10
minutes. In this case, the first few cars in the caravan will arrive at
the second toll booth before the last cars in caravan leave the first toll
booth. This situation also arises in packet-switched networks--the first
bits in a packet can arrive at a router while many of the remaining bits
in the packet are still waiting to be transmitted by the preceding router.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>If we let <i>d</i><sub>proc</sub><i>,
d</i><sub>queue</sub>,<i> d</i><sub>trans</sub>, and <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub>
denote the processing, queuing, transmission, and propagation delays, then
the total nodal delay is given by&nbsp;</font></font>
<center>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0><i>d</i><sub>nodal</sub>
= <i>d</i><sub>proc</sub> + <i>d</i><sub>queue</sub> + <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub>
+ <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub></font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The contribution
of these delay components can vary significantly. For example, <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub>
can be negligible (for example, a couple of microseconds) for a link connecting
two routers on the same university campus; however, <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub>
is hundreds of milliseconds for two routers interconnected by a geostationary
satellite link, and can be the dominant term in <i>d</i><sub>nodal</sub>.
Similarly, <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub> can range from negligible to significant.
Its contribution is typically negligible for transmission rates of 10 Mbps
and higher (for example, for LANs); however, it can be hundreds of milliseconds
for large Internet packets sent over 28.8 Kbps modem links. The processing
delay, <i>d</i><sub>proc</sub>, is often negligible; however, it strongly
influences a router's maximum throughput, which is the maximum rate at
which a router can forward packets.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Queuing Delay</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The most complicated
and interesting component of nodal delay is the queuing delay, <i>d</i><sub>queue</sub>.
In fact, queuing delay is so important and interesting in computer networking
that thousands of papers and numerous books have been written about it

1995</a>]! We give only a high-level, intuitive discussion of queuing delay
here; the more curious reader may want to browse through some of the books
(or even eventually write a Ph.D. thesis on the subject!). Unlike the other
three delays (namely, <i>d</i><sub>proc</sub>,<i> d</i><sub>trans</sub>,
and <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub>), the queuing delay can vary from packet to
packet. For example, if 10 packets arrive at an empty queue at the same
time, the first packet transmitted will suffer no queuing delay, while
the last packet transmitted will suffer a relatively large queuing delay
(while it waits for the other nine packets to be transmitted). Therefore,
when characterizing queuing delay, one typically uses statistical measures,
such as average queuing delay, variance of queuing delay, and the probability
that the queuing delay exceeds some specified value.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>When is the
queuing delay large and when is it insignificant? The answer to this question
depends largely on the rate at which traffic arrives to the queue, the
transmission rate of the link, and the nature of the arriving traffic,
that is, whether the traffic arrives periodically or whether it arrives
in bursts. To gain some insight here, let <i>a</i> denote the average rate
at which packets arrive to the queue (<i>a</i> is in units of packets/sec).
Recall that <i>R</i> is the transmission rate, that is, it is the rate
(in bits/sec) at which bits are pushed out of the queue. Also suppose,
for simplicity, that all packets consist of <i>L</i> bits. Then the average
rate at which bits arrive to the queue is <i>La </i>bits/sec. Finally,
assume that the queue is very big, so that it can hold essentially an infinite
number of bits. The ratio <i>La/R,</i> called the <b>traffic intensity,</b>
often plays an important role in estimating the extent of the queuing delay.
If <i>La/R</i> > 1, then the average rate at which bits arrive to the queue
exceeds the rate at which the bits can be transmitted from the queue. In
this unfortunate situation, the queue will tend to increase without bound
and the queuing delay will approach infinity! Therefore, one of the golden
rules in traffic engineering is: <i>Design your system so that the traffic
intensity is no greater than 1.&nbsp;</i></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Now consider
the case <i>La/R<img SRC="le.gif" ALT="less than or equal to" ></i> 1.
Here, the nature of the arriving traffic impacts the queuing delay. For
example, if packets arrive periodically, that is, one packet arrives every
<i>L/R</i> seconds, then every packet will arrive to an empty queue and
there will be no queuing delay. On the other hand, if packets arrive in
bursts but periodically, there can be a significant average queuing delay.
For example, suppose <i>N</i> packets arrive at the same time every <i>(L/R)N</i>
seconds. Then the first packet transmitted has no queuing delay; the second
packet transmitted has a queuing delay of <i>L/R</i> seconds; and more
generally, the <i>n</i>th packet transmitted has a queuing delay of (<i>n</i>
- 1)<i>L/R</i> seconds. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to calculate
the average queuing delay in this example.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The two examples
described above of periodic arrivals are a bit academic. Typically, the
arrival process to a queue is <i>random,</i> that is, the arrivals do not
follow any pattern; packets are spaced apart by random amounts of time.
In this more realistic case, the quantity <i>La/R</i> is not usually sufficient
to fully characterize the delay statistics. Nonetheless, it is useful in
gaining an intuitive understanding of the extent of the queuing delay.
In particular, if traffic intensity is close to zero, then packet arrivals
are few and far between and it is unlikely that an arriving packet will
find another packet in the queue. Hence, the average queuing delay will
be close to zero. On the other hand, when the traffic intensity is close
to 1, there will be intervals of time when the arrival rate exceeds the
transmission capacity (due to the burstiness of arrivals), and a queue
will form. As the traffic intensity approaches 1, the average queue length
gets larger and larger. The qualitative dependence of average queuing delay
on the traffic intensity is shown in Figure 1.20.&nbsp;</font></font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="01-20.jpg" ALT="Figure 1.20" height=247 width=300>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=-1><b>Figure 1.20:</b>
Dependence of average queuing delay on traffic density</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>One important
aspect of Figure 1.20 is the fact that as the traffic intensity approaches
1, the average queuing delay increases rapidly. A small percentage increase
in the intensity will result in a much larger percentage-wise increase
in delay. Perhaps you have experienced this phenomenon on the highway.
If you regularly drive on a road that is typically congested, the fact
that the road is typically congested means that its traffic intensity is
close to 1. If some event causes an even slightly larger-than-usual amount
of traffic, the delays you experience can be huge.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Packet Loss</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>In our discussions
above, we have assumed that the queue is capable of holding an infinite
number of packets. In reality a queue preceding a link has finite capacity,
although the queuing capacity greatly depends on the switch design and
cost. Because the queue capacity is finite, packet delays do not really
approach infinity as the traffic intensity approaches 1. Instead, a packet
can arrive to find a full queue. With no place to store such a packet,
a router will <b>drop</b> that packet; that is, the packet will be <b>lost.</b>
From an end-system viewpoint, this will look like a packet having been
transmitted into the network core, but never emerging from the network
at the destination. The fraction of lost packets increases as the traffic
intensity increases. Therefore, performance at a node is often measured
not only in terms of delay, but also in terms of the probability of packet
loss. As we shall discuss in the subsequent chapters, a lost packet may
be retransmitted on an end-to-end basis, by either the application or by
the transport layer protocol.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>End-to-End
Delay</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Our discussion
up to this point has been focused on the nodal delay, that is, the delay
at a single router. Let us conclude our discussion by briefly considering
the delay from source to destination. To get a handle on this concept,
suppose there are <i>Q</i>-1 routers between the source host and the destination
host. Let us also suppose that the network is uncongested (so that queuing
delays are negligible), the processing delay at each router and at the
source host is <i>d</i><sub>proc</sub>, the transmission rate out of each
router and out of the source host is <i>R</i> bits/sec, and the propagation
delay between each pair or routers and between the source host and the
first router is <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub>. The nodal delays accumulate and
give an end-to-end delay,&nbsp;</font></font>
<center>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0><i>d</i><sub>end-end</sub>
= <i>Q</i> (<i>d</i><sub>proc</sub> + <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub> + <i>d</i><sub>prop</sub>)&nbsp;</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>where, once
again, <i>d</i><sub>trans</sub> = <i>L/R, </i>where <i>L</i> is the packet
size. We leave it to the reader to generalize this formula to the case
of heterogeneous delays at the nodes and to the presence of an average
queuing delay at each node.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
