<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>In this book
we use the public Internet, a specific computer network (and one which
probably most readers have used), as our principle vehicle for discussing
computer networking protocols. But what is the Internet? We would like
to be able to give you a one-sentence definition of the Internet, a definition
that you can take home and share with your family and friends. Alas, the
Internet is very complex, both in terms of its hardware and software components,
as well as in the services it provides.&nbsp;</font></font>
<h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>1.1.1: A Nuts and
Bolts Description</font></font></h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Instead of giving
a one-sentence definition, let's try a more descriptive approach. There
are a couple of ways to do this. One way is to describe the nuts and bolts
of the Internet, that is, the basic hardware and software components that
make up the Internet. Another way is to describe the Internet in terms
of a networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications.
Let's begin with the nuts-and-bolts description, using Figure 1.1 to illustrate
our discussion.&nbsp;</font></font>
<center>
<p><img SRC="01-01.jpg" ALT="Figure 1.1" height=427 width=480>

Some pieces of the Internet</font></font></center>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The public Internet
is a world-wide <b>computer network,</b> that is, a network that interconnects
millions of computing devices throughout the world. Most of these computing
devices are traditional desktop PCs, Unix-based workstations, and so called
servers that store and transmit information such as Web (WWW) pages and
e-mail messages. Increasingly, nontraditional computing devices such as
Web TVs, mobile computers, pagers, and toasters are being connected to
the Internet. (Toasters are not the only rather unusual devices to have
been hooked up to the Internet; see the "The Future of the Living Room"
[<a href="http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/kurose-ross1/chapter2/custom11/deluxe-content.html#greenberg1997" target="_new">Greenberg
1997</a>].) In the Internet jargon, all of these devices are called <b>hosts</b>
or <b>end systems.</b> The Internet applications with which many of us
are familiar, such as the Web and e-mail, are <b>network application programs</b>
that run on such end systems. We will look into Internet end systems in
more detail in Section 1.3 and then delve deeply into the study of network
applications in Chapter 2.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>End systems,
as well as most other "pieces" of the Internet, run <b>protocols</b> that
control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. <b>TCP</b>
(the Transmission Control Protocol) and <b>IP</b> (the Internet Protocol)
are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. The Internet's
principal protocols are collectively known as <b>TCP/IP. </b>We begin looking
into protocols in Section 1.2. But that's just a start--much of this book
is concerned with computer network protocols!&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>End systems
are connected together by <b>communication links.</b> We'll see in Section
1.5 that there are many types of communication links. Links are made up
of different types of <b>physical media,</b> including coaxial cable, copper
wire, fiber optics, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit data
at different rates. The link transmission rate is often called the <b>link
bandwidth</b> and is typically measured in bits/second.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Usually, end
systems are not directly attached to each other via a single communication
link. Instead, they are indirectly connected to each other through intermediate
switching devices known as <b>routers.</b> A router takes information arriving
on one of its incoming communication links and then forwards that information
on one of its outgoing communication links. The <b>IP protocol</b> specifies
the format of the information that is sent and received among routers and
end systems. The path that transmitted information takes from the sending
end system, through a series of communications links and routers, to the
receiving end system is known as a <b>route</b> or <b>path</b> through
the network. We introduce routing in more detail in Section 1.4 and study
the algorithms used to determine routes, as well as the internal structure
of a router itself, in Chapter 4.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Rather than
provide a <i>dedicated</i> path between communicating end systems, the
Internet uses a technique known as <b>packet switching</b> that allows
multiple communicating end systems to share a path, or parts of a path,
at the same time. The earliest ancestors of the Internet were the first
packet-switched networks.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The Internet
is really a network of networks. That is, the Internet is an interconnected
set of privately and publicly owned and managed networks. Any network connected
to the Internet must run the IP protocol and conform to certain naming
and addressing conventions. Other than these few constraints, however,
a network operator can configure and run its network (that is, its little
piece of the Internet) however it chooses. Because of the universal use
of the IP protocol in the Internet, the IP protocol is sometimes referred
to as the <b>Internet dial tone.</b></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The topology
of the Internet, that is, the structure of the interconnection among the
various pieces of the Internet, is loosely hierarchical. Roughly speaking,
from bottom-to-top, the hierarchy consists of end systems connected to
local <b>Internet service providers (ISPs)</b> though <b>access networks.</b>
An access network may be a so-called local area network within a company
or university, a dial telephone line with a modem, or a high-speed cable-based
or phone-based access network. Local ISPs are in turn connected to regional
ISPs, which are in turn connected to national and international ISPs. The
national and international ISPs are connected together at the highest tier
in the hierarchy. New tiers and branches (that is, new networks, and new
networks of networks) can be added just as a new piece of Lego can be attached
to an existing Lego construction. In the first half of 1996, approximately
40,000 <i>new</i> networks were added to the Internet [<a href="http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/kurose-ross1/chapter2/custom11/deluxe-content.html#network1996" target="_new">Network
1996</a>]--an astounding growth rate.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>At the technical
and developmental level, the Internet is made possible through creation,
testing, and implementation of <b>Internet standards.</b> These standards
are developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF standards
documents are called <b>RFCs</b> (request for comments). RFCs started out
as general request for comments (hence the name) to resolve architecture
problems that faced the precursor to the Internet. RFCs, though not formally
standards, have evolved to the point where they are cited as such. RFCs
tend to be quite technical and detailed. They define protocols such as
TCP, IP, HTTP (for the Web), and SMTP (for open-standards e-mail). There
are more than 2,000 different RFCs.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The public Internet
(that is, the global network of networks discussed above) is the network
that one typically refers to as<i> the</i> Internet. There are also many
private networks, such as certain corporate and government networks, whose
hosts are not accessible from (that is, they cannot exchange messages with)
hosts outside of that private network. These private networks are often
referred to as <b>intranets,</b> as they often use the same Internet technology
(for example, the same types of host, routers, links, protocols, and standards)
as the public Internet.&nbsp;</font></font>
<h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>1.1.2: A Service
Description</font></font></h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The preceding discussion
has identified many of the pieces that make up the Internet. Let's now
leave the nuts-and-bolts description and take a more abstract, service-oriented
view:&nbsp;</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The Internet allows
<b>distributed
applications</b> running on its end systems to exchange data with each
other. These applications include remote login, file transfer, electronic
mail, audio and video streaming, real-time audio and video conferencing,
distributed games, the World Wide Web, and much, much more [<a href="http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/kurose-ross1/chapter2/custom11/deluxe-content.html#attapps1998" target="_new">AT&amp;T
Apps 1998</a>]. It is worth emphasizing that the Web is not a separate
network but rather just one of many distributed applications that use the
communication services provided by the Internet. The Web <i>could</i> also
run over a network besides the Internet. One reason that the Internet is
the communication medium of choice for the Web, however, is that no other
existing packet-switched network connects more than 43 million [<a href="http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/kurose-ross1/chapter2/custom11/deluxe-content.html#network1999" target="_new">Network
1999</a>] computers together and has over 100 million users [<a href="http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/kurose-ross1/chapter2/custom11/deluxe-content.html#almanac1998" target="_new">Almanac
1998</a>]. (By the way, determining the number of computers hooked up to
the Internet is a very difficult task, as no one is responsible for maintaining
a list of who's connected. When a new network is added to the Internet,
its administrators do not need to report which end systems are connected
to that network. Similarly, an exiting network does not report its changes
in connected end systems to any central authority.)&nbsp;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>The Internet provides
two services to its distributed applications: a <b>connection-oriented
service</b> and a <b>connectionless service.</b> Loosely speaking, connection-oriented
service guarantees that data transmitted from a sender to a receiver will
eventually be delivered to the receiver in order and in its entirety. Connectionless
service does not make any guarantees about eventual delivery. Typically,
a distributed application makes use of one or the other of these two services
and not both. We examine these two different services in Section 1.3 and
in great detail in Chapter 3.&nbsp;</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Currently, the
Internet does not provide a service that makes promises about <i>how long
</i>it
will take to deliver the data from sender to receiver. And except for increasing
your access bit rate to your Internet service provider, you currently cannot
obtain better service (for example, shorter delays) by paying more--a state
of affairs that some (particularly Americans!) find odd. We'll take a look
at state-of-the art Internet research that is aimed at changing this situation
in Chapter 6.&nbsp;</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>Our second description
of the Internet--in terms of the services it provides to distributed applications--is
a nontraditional, but important, one. Increasingly, advances in the nuts-and-bolts
components of the Internet are being driven by the needs of new applications.
So it's important to keep in mind that the Internet is an <i>infrastructure</i>
in which new applications are being constantly invented and deployed.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>We have given
two descriptions of the Internet, one in terms of its hardware and software
components, the other in terms of the services it provides to distributed
applications. But perhaps you are still confused as to what the Internet
is. What is packet switching, TCP/IP, and connection-oriented service?
What are routers? What kinds of communication links are present in the
Internet? What is a distributed application? What does the Internet have
to do with children's toys? If you feel a bit overwhelmed by all of this
now, don't worry--the purpose of this book is to introduce you to both
the nuts and bolts of the Internet, as well as the principles that govern
how and why it works. We will explain these important terms and questions
in the subsequent sections and chapters.&nbsp;</font></font>
<h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>1.1.3: Some Good
Hyperlinks</font></font></h3>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"><font size=+0>As every Internet
researcher knows, some of the best and most accurate information about
the Internet and its protocols is not in hard-copy books, journals, or
magazines. The best stuff about the Internet is in the Internet itself!
Of course, there's really too much material to sift through, and sometimes
the gems are few and far between. Below, we list a few generally excellent
Web sites for network- and Internet-related material. Throughout the book,
we will also present links to relevant, high quality URLs that provide
background, original, or advanced material related to the particular topic
under study. Here is a set of key links that you may want to consult while
